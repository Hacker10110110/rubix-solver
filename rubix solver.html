# Install required package first:
# pip install rubik-solver

from rubik_solver import utils

# Define cube colors as a string:
# Order: U (up), R (right), F (front), D (down), L (left), B (back)
# Colors are represented by letters, e.g.:
# U = white (w), R = red (r), F = green (g), D = yellow (y), L = orange (o), B = blue (b)

# Example scrambled cube state:
cube_state = (
    "wwwwwwwww"  # Up face
    "rrrrrrrrr"  # Right face
    "ggggggggg"  # Front face
    "yyyyyyyyy"  # Down face
    "ooooooooo"  # Left face
    "bbbbbbbbb"  # Back face
)

# Get the solution
solution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')
